# Bike Sales Dashboard – Excel Project
Overview
This project is a simple yet insightful Bike Sales Dashboard built in Microsoft Excel.
I created it to practice data cleaning, visualization, and dashboard design — and to see how customer demographics influence bike purchases.

The dashboard is fully interactive, easy to navigate, and highlights patterns that help understand buyer behavior.
